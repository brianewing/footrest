Footrest: Lightweight ODM for CouchDB on Node
========

What is this is don't even?
---------------------------

Footrest lets you define models that will be backed by a Couch database.
It tries to work in exactly the way you'd expect it to, with an ActiveRecord-esque API.

Whilst it's still being put together, footrest will support callbacks (beforeSave, afterSave, etc) and validations.

**See below for examples.**

Footrest was designed to be used in **CoffeeScript**.
For now, using it in Javascript will be an exercise for the reader as it ties in nicely with CoffeeScript's classical inheritance.

Read the tests for a better idea how footrest can be used until better documentation is available

Running the tests
------------

0. `npm install`
0. `npm test`
0. Watch it pass â˜º

Long example
------------

Hopefully this feels as natural to you as it does to me.

    Model = require('footrest').Model

    # this can be set per-model in the class definition, at runtime, etc
    Model.database = require('footrest').database('footrest')

    class Animal extends Model
      @type 'Animal'
      @attr 'species', 'name'

    class Dog extends Animal
      @attr 'name'
      @attr 'species', default: 'dog'
      @attr 'breed', default: 'greyhound'
      @attr('bites', default: true)

      strokeable: ->
        @cute or not @bites

    class Terrier extends Dog
      @attr 'breed', default: 'west_highland_terrier'
      @attr 'bites', default: false
      @attr 'cute', default: true

    spot = new Dog
      name: 'Spot'

    oscar = new Terrier(name: 'Oscar')

    oscar.strokeable() # => true
    spot.strokeable() # => false
    oscar.species # => 'dog'

    oscar.cute = false
    oscar.bites = true
    oscar.strokeable() # => true

    oscar.id # => null
    oscar.hello # => undefined

    oscar.save (success) ->
      oscar.id # => "73e98a88a53cbd6d9028a03d6e004fe4"
      oscar.rev # => "1-c3f75784f5f9a82faadac4ded1306412"
